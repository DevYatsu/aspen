# Aspen - My scripting language.

After [ComfyScript](https://github.com/DevYatsu/ComfyScript.git), [JadeFlow](https://github.com/DevYatsu/JadeFlow.git) and [plk_fast](https://github.com/DevYatsu/pkl_fast.git), after losing hours and hours of work in order to create a true parser/interpreter, here we are.
